The advent of IoT brought major changes in the industry standards, today we can get our tasks done easily without physical interaction just with the help of our devices connected to internet ranging from ordering food, gadgets and clothes etc.

Our project objective is to design an IoT based home automation system, which can ease our daily tasks and enhance the productivity.
