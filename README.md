# IoT-Based-Home-Automation-System üè†ü§≥

The advent of IoT brought major changes in the industry standards, today we can get our tasks done easily without physical interaction just with the help of our devices connected to internet ranging from ordering food, gadgets and clothes etc.

Our project objective is to design an IoT based home automation system, which can ease our daily tasks and enhance the productivity. In this project we are making use of some tools such as Proteus Simulator, Bluetooth HC05 Modules, Transistors, LED‚Äôs, DC Motors etc. The main purpose is to remotely controlling all our home appliances and electronic items such as Lights, Air Conditioner, Fans etc. using voice commands via an android application developed by us.
